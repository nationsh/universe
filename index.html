    <p style="width: 500px;">Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur, inventor, and engineer best known for founding and leading several high-profile technology companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. Born in South Africa in 1971, Musk moved to the U.S. to attend the University of Pennsylvania and later dropped out of Stanford to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions. He gained early success with ventures like Zip2 and PayPal, which he sold for millions. Muskâ€™s vision for the future is deeply rooted in sustainability and space exploration, with Tesla pushing electric vehicles to the forefront of the automotive industry and SpaceX working to make space travel more accessible, including plans for interplanetary colonization. His bold, sometimes controversial ideas, such as the development of a high-speed transportation system (Hyperloop) and brain-computer interfaces, have made him one of the most influential and polarizing figures in the tech world today. In 2023, Elon Musk acquired Twitter and quickly made significant changes, ultimately rebranding the platform to X in an effort to transform it into a broader "everything app." Musk envisions X as a platform that could encompass social media, financial services, and other digital experiences, similar to China's WeChat. Since taking control, Musk has made numerous adjustments to the platform's policies, user experience, and content moderation, which have sparked both support and criticism. X continues to be a major part of Musk's vision to reshape global communication and online interaction, further solidifying his influence in the tech space.</p>
